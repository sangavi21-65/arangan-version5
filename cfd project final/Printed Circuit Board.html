		   <h1>Description</h1>
		<h2>Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Submerge Cooling CFD Simulation</h2>
        <p>This research offers a numerical investigation of fluid dynamics and heat transfer in two-phase <b>submerge cooling</b> systems.
		The subject of this work is chips with internship components orientated 
		vertically on a <b>printed circuit board (PCB)</b> submerged in dielectric 
		<b>HydroFluoroEther (HFE)—7100.</b> The main objective is to investigate and grasp 
		how these components’ physical architecture and geometry affect the flow routes
		of bubbles, the phenomenon of bubble coalescence, and the vapor coverage on chip surfaces.</p>
        <p><b>Space Claim</b> software generated the project’s geometry, guaranteeing exact modeling of the Printed Circuit Board and internship components. A structured mesh was produced using <b>ANSYS Meshing,</b> enabling correct numerical simulations with more than 19,000 components for this shape.</p>
        <p>The transient solver is also activated since the issue at hand calls for examining changes in the volume fraction of the stated phases. The study considered gravity’s effect; in the Y direction, it was fixed at -9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</p>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>The PCB in this study was modelled using <b>ANSYS Fluent</b> software. Evaporation and condensation <b>mass transfer</b> mechanisms were simulated using a <b>multiphase VOF</b> model. Moreover, the dielectric material for this project was set at 339 K saturation temperature. The turbulent fluid equations were also solved using the conventional <b>k-epsilon</b> model and energy equation, which let one compute temperature distribution inside the domain.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The research investigates the fluid dynamics and heat transfer in a two-phase submerge cooling system with vertically mounted chips and an internship component. This paper uses a two-dimensional computational model based on the finite volume method and the VOF model to study the influence of the internship component on the deflection of bubble streamlines, bubble coalescence processes on heated chips, and the cooling rate. Results showed that the internship component could significantly affect chip heat transfer. This paper emphasizes the need for the topology of electronic systems in the efficiency of two-phase cooling and provides interesting research for creating electronic systems for effective cooling.</p>
