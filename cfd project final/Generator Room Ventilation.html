			   <h1>Description</h1>
			<h2>Generator Room Ventilation, Numerical Study, Industrial Application</h2>
			<img src="">
			<p>In this project, the heating, ventilation, and Air Conditioning <b>(HVAC)</b> of a <b>generator room</b> are simulated using Ansys Fluent software. After completing the simulations, in which a generator room is initially simulated without a fan, it is observed that the room temperature with 32 generators is very high. 32 fans with 11,000 CFM are used, which decreases the Temperature considerably. But to improve ventilation and Temperature and obtain the desired <b>thermal comfort</b> between generator rows, 32 fans with 36,500 CFM have been added.</p>
			<h2>Purpose Generator Room</h2>
			<p>Generators are one of the most widely used and essential sources of Electricity in various industries. Generators generate much heat, affecting thermal comfort if several generators are together. Therefore, operators can not approach the generators in summer due to extreme heat. So to solve this problem, we used several fans to make the room temperature of the generator suitable for the operators.</p>
			<h2>Introduction Generator Room</h2>
			<p>In 1845, Michael Faraday, a prominent English physicist and chemist, showed that light and magnetic force are related and thus discovered Faraday’s work. Faraday’s discovery paved the way for the construction of the generator. About 50 years later, a German inventor named Carl Diesel revolutionized the electricity industry with the invention of the diesel engine. Diesel generator or diesel generator machine has been used for many years in all places, whether in hospitals or remote villages and in any place where access to Electricity from power plants is impossible.</p>
			<p>Diesel generators generate emergency power and supply the necessary power continuously, either during peak consumption or even when the shortage of Electricity is felt. Ships and many large land vehicles, such as trains, also use diesel generators to provide lighting power and provide the propulsion they need. With electric propulsion, more constant and powerful movement can be done, and more appropriate use of space. Electric propulsion was used in ships before World War I and evolved during World War II. <b>Power generation</b> devices are classified and named in kilowatts based on average to maximum production capacity and based on generating power and are selected for continuous or emergency depending on the type of consumption.</p>
			<p>A high-speed and robust <b>industrial fan</b> is one of the essential pieces of equipment in large industrial environments. Because despite the number of personnel, the presence of large devices, the entry of gases and pollutants, and other reasons, the oxygen in industrial environments is reduced. To increase the work efficiency of all departments, a high-speed industrial fan with high suction is needed.</p>
			<p>An industrial fan <b>or industrial ventilator</b> is an important device in large work environments such as sheds, factories, greenhouses, industrial halls, clubs, large centers, etc. Since to increase work efficiency and better breathing, air circulation is needed to supply the required oxygen and create good air, the existence of devices that can rotate a large volume of trapped air and clean the air. A high-speed industrial fan device should be included in the agenda from this purchase.</p>
			<h2>Generator</h2>
			<p>A generator is a machine that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy through electromagnetic induction. A diesel generator is also a generator that uses diesel fuel to generate Electricity.</p>		
			<p>A diesel generator combines a diesel engine with an electric generator (often a dynamo) to generate electrical energy.</p>
			<p>Diesel generators today have many applications in industry and even in everyday life. These motors are usually used in places with no access to Electricity. The primary purpose of diesel generators is to generate Electricity.</p>
			<p>Diesel generators are usually produced and supplied in different dimensions for different applications. These dimensions are determined based on their apparent power. The generator used in this project is CAT C175-20 which has a power of 4000 kW.</p>

			<h2>Advantages of Diesel Generator</h2>
			<p>It is known that diesel generators require less maintenance than other generators on the market. Because the generator engine requires fewer components to start, you no longer have to worry about replacing spark plugs or rebuilding carburetors.</p>
	<p>They are less sensitive to fuel and can use cheaper fuels such as diesel, oil, and fuel oil. Fuel should be one of the most important items for anyone buying a generator. Although diesel prices may be slightly higher than other fuel sources, these generators consume less than gas generators when doing the same job.</p>
	<p>Diesel fuel storage is much safer than other fuel types, such as gasoline, which explodes quickly and catches fire easily if spilled. On the other hand, diesel has a much lower risk of ignition. It also lasts longer than gasoline to get better quality fuel from your stored source.</p>
	<p>Increase life expectancy</p>
	<p>Continuous power supply</p>
	<p>When you experience a shutdown, an excellent and reliable diesel generator proves to work and your vital power systems for a long time. It minimizes downtime so that your facility does not experience significant financial losses while you wait for power to return.</p>
	<p>Diesel generators can control larger loads and operate for longer than other existing generators. It makes them viable for remote sites where the power grid may be unreliable.</p>
	<h2>Disadvantages of Diesel Generators</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Noise</li>
		<li>Cost</li>
		<li>Pollution</li>
		<li>Large-Volume</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Fan</h2>
	<p>A <b>high-speed centrifugal blower</b> and an industrial <b>suction fan</b> are used in polluted, dirty, and impure air. In addition, this industrial fan is used for areas with high temperatures. In this project, TPI Commercial Belt Drive Drum Fan model CPB 42-B with a capacity of 13,500 CFM and AEROVENT model fan with 11,000 CFM have been used.</p>
	<h2>Simulation</h2>
	<p>The <b>Design Modeler</b> Software designs the geometry. The meshing of this present model has been generated by <b>Ansys Meshing</b> software. The mesh grid is structured, and the total cell number is more than 3854957. generator room simulations are performed steadily with the energy equation, and the k-ε model is Realizable as the turbulence model. The fluid used in this simulation is air for the continuous phase. Coupling of velocity and pressure equations is also performed using the Coupled algorithm. (It should be noted that to reduce the computational cost due to the symmetry of half of the geometry being simulated.</p>

	<h2>Generator Room Result</h2>
	<p>This project aimed to provide suitable thermal comfort for the generator room. In the first simulation, when no fan was on, it was observed that the Temperature between the generators was more than 49 ° C. Therefore, it was decided to use a fan to reduce the Temperature. Thus, in the second simulation, 32 small fans are used, each with 11,000 CFM. We concluded that the room temperature is improved and reduced to 36 ° C. Then it was decided to use 64 fans (32 fans 11,000 CFM and 32 fans 13,500 CFM) to improve the thermal comfort of the generator room in the next simulation. The latest simulation results show that the airflow velocity inside the room has improved compared to the previous simulation, and the Temperature between the generators is equal to the outside Temperature <b>(30 ° C)</b>.</p>
